A command-line representation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle

The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle where a tower made of discs of decreasing size needs to be moved from place to place. Only one disc can be moved at a time and larger discs can't be placed on top of smaller ones.

Discs can be placed on three spindles: A, B and C. The tower starts on spindle A and discs can be moved by inputting the starting spindle followed by the destination, for example 'ab' to move the top disc from spindle A onto the stack at B.

This is my solution to a practice project from chapter 14 of Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart
